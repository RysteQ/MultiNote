## About

Multinote is (or plans to be) a notepad++ lookalike made in C#

As of now it is just a normal text editor with no syntax highlighting but I plan on improving it and making it highly costumizable, I do not know how long that will take me but I don't expect it to be that far into the future.

Also, just a head up. This project is in a very early stage so it isn't polished or debugged properly so bear that in mind.

## Future plans

My future plans are the following:

1) Refactoring: I doubt the code is at an optimal state and this is going to get worse in the near future especially with the features I am planning will later add

2) Syntax Highlighter: I will later add a syntax highlighter because I just think it's cool, there is nothing more to that

3) Costumizability: I really want to make this text editor highly costumizable so you can do all sorts of things with it, I doubt I will be able to make it but it's not out of the table just yet

## Contributing

If you want to contribute that would be really nice although I would prefer just to report bugs and such in my code or suggest to me on how I can make the code faster and cleaner, this is a project meant for me to learn C# in the end.
